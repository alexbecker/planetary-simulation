This program is intended to compute the positions of astronomical
objects given their mass, radius, and initial position and velocity.
To do so it numerically solves the n-body problem, keeping track of
an upper bound on the error, and shrinks the step size until the
error is acceptable. It is called from the command line using:
 ./PlanetarySimulation filename endtime max_error [start_step] [c_s]
Filename is the path of an ASCII text file formatted as follows:
 system_name number_of_objects coordinate_system
 name mass position velocity
 ...
 name mass position velocity
Coordinate system is the system of coordinates used to specify the
position of each object, and is either "c" for Cartesian or "s" for
(mathematical) spherical. The default is Cartesian. Position is the 
position of the object in the specified coordinates, seperated by
spaces, and velocity is the velocity of the object in Cartesian
coordinates. Endtime is the length of time to simulate. Max_error is
the largest acceptable error in the final position of any object. The
optional argument start_step specifies the step size used initially
by the program. Since the error produced by the algorithm is
generally much smaller than the upper bound, it may be desirable to
specify the step size and set max_error to 1e308, so it is ignored.
C_s is the coordinate system which will be used to print the output.
